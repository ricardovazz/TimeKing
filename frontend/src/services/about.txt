The services layer handles all http communication with backend apis 
for the application

-each service encapsulates the api calls 
for a content type (e.g. users) and exposes methods 
for performing various operations (e.g. CRUD operations). 

Services can also have methods that don't wrap http calls, 
for example the authenticationService.logout() method just 
removes the currentUser object from localStorage and 
sets it to null in the application.

Wrapping http calls and implementation details in a 
services layer provides a clean separation 
of concerns and simplifies the react components that use the services
